## Project Overview
This project analyzes a loan portfolio using Python to evaluate repayment behavior, default patterns, and portfolio risk exposure. The objective is to transform raw loan and transaction data into actionable insights that support credit and risk management decision-making.

The analysis focuses on understanding where risk is concentrated, how repayment behavior differs across segments, and how early warning signs appear before loan default.

## Business Problem
Financial institutions often lack a consolidated view of loan performance across products, regions, and customer segments. Without timely visibility into repayment trends and delinquency patterns, risk mitigation actions tend to be reactive rather than preventive.

This case study addresses the following questions:
- Which loan products carry the highest default risk?
- How does repayment behavior vary across customer segments?
- Where is portfolio risk accumulating?

## Dataset Description
The analysis is based on a simulated loan management dataset consisting of:

- **Loan Data:** Loan amount, interest rate, loan term, loan type, approval date, and loan status.
- **Customer Data:** Demographics, regional attributes, and credit score information.
- **Transaction Data:** Loan disbursements and repayments at transaction level.

The datasets were cleaned, standardized, and merged to create a unified loan-level analytical view.
